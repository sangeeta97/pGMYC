    GMYC.py    Implements the single threshold general mixed Yule coalescent 
               (GMYC) model which was first proposed by Pons et al 
               (Sequence-Based Species Delimitation for the DNA Taxonomy 
               of Undescribed Insects. Systematic Biology, 55(4), 595â€“609)
               This model requires the input tree to be time calibrated 
               ultrametric tree, in other words, the branch length of the 
               input ultrametric tree should represent time. 
               The most commonly used programs for getting an ultrametric
               tree are BEAST, DPPDIV and r8s. There is also an R 
               implementation of this model called "splits" by Tomochika 
               Fujisawa (http://barralab.bio.ic.ac.uk/downloads.html)
               To find out how to use it, type ./GMYC.py
